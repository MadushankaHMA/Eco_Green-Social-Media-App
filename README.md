# Eco Green Social media platform

The Eco Green application offers a user-friendly and innovative solution for effective nondisposable waste management. It provides individuals with a convenient platform to 
responsibly dispose of their non-disposable recyclable items, such as plastic bottles and glass 
containers, while also encouraging and rewarding sustainable behavior. Using the Eco Green 
application, users can easily connect with Eco Green bins by scanning unique QR codes. The 
bins' lids open, allowing users to insert their non-disposable items. The built-in scanner 
categorizes the items, and the app displays the count for each category, showcasing users' 
recycling efforts. Active participation in recycling efforts is incentivized through Eco coins, 
which can be accumulated and used for discounts on purchases from the Eco Green store. The 
store offers a range of innovative products created from the collected non-disposable items, 
promoting the reuse and repurposing of materials. The Eco Green application ensures 
efficient waste management by notifying both users and the company when a bin becomes 
full. This facilitates timely collection and prevents overflowing bins, maintaining a clean and 
well-managed waste disposal system. Overall, the Eco Green solution combines convenience, 
eco-friendliness, incentivization, and closed-loop recycling. By providing a user-friendly 
a platform for responsible waste disposal, encouraging sustainable behavior through rewards, 
and repurposing collected items into new products, the Eco Green application contributes to 
environmental sustainability and addresses the challenges of non-disposable waste.
